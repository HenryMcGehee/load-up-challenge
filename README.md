# Criteria

* Has a single button in the center called "Current Weather"
* Upon click, it uses the built-in browser Geolocation API to get the user's location
* The application then grabs the current weather for that location from OpenWeatherMap and displays it on the page
* Deploy your project somewhere so it's accessible from the web. Heroku or a static host if you're going that route are perfectly fine.
